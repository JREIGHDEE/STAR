In the hush of the world,
we found each other
limbs tangled, hearts louder than any sound,
in the quiet cradle of the bed.

You kissed my cheek,
and without thinking,
I placed my hand gently over your mouth —
"Stop," I breathed,

because I knew I wouldn’t be able to.
"Stop from what?" you asked,
your voice trembling against my palm.
"From kissing you," I confessed,

the words heavier, sweeter than air.
You paused,
and in that silence,
I heard the roar of my own heart,

felt the ache in my bones to be closer still.
I told myself I would understand
if you weren't ready,
if it was too soon.

I would have waited a lifetime.
You thought,
quiet and beautiful,
your brow soft with some secret decision.

I waited — breathless, desperate,
afraid to hope.
Then you shifted, just enough
a silent answer.

And in my rushing excitement,
I kissed you first.
Our first kiss.
My first kiss.

It shattered something inside me
a bloom of feeling too big for my chest.
Still, I grinned against your mouth,
kissing you again, and again,

teasing, tasting, lost.
Somehow, all my fear melted,
confidence springing from the sheer wonder of you.
Your lips, at first chapped and tender,

grew softer with every kiss,
until I was drunk on the feeling of you.
Addicted
from the first breath,

the first touch,
the first infinite moment
where the world outside ceased to exist,
and there was only you, and me,

and the silence that held us.
