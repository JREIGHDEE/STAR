                <p><em>To my Beloved,<em></p>
                <p>Now, here I am in college, and I can’t believe how far I’ve come. Or maybe, how far I had to go to understand who I am. I wasn’t just a girl. I’m a boy. I’ve always been a boy, even if I didn’t realize it then. But in this space, away from the confusion and the fears, I finally saw it. I finally saw me. And it felt like everything fell into place. I remember thinking, <em>What if she doesn’t see me the same? What if I lose her forever?</em></p>
                <p>But then, I realized something else. My love for her hadn’t changed. If anything, it had only grown stronger, deeper. It had always been there, even when I was pretending not to feel it. Even when I was too scared to accept it. I’m Reigh now. But my heart… my heart is the same.</p>
                <p>I think she knew. She must have. She saw me, in every form – the girl, the boy, all the versions of me that have existed. But no matter who I was, she always loved me the same.</p>
                <p>I remember one day, sitting next to her, and feeling this wave of truth come over me. It was like I wanted to say, <em>Do you know? Do you see me for who I really am?</em> And even though I didn’t speak it aloud, I could feel that she did. And she was still here. She was still holding onto me, still steady through it all. I wasn’t just a confused girl anymore, and yet, she was still there. That meant everything to me.</p>
                <p>I remember thinking, <em>I’ve changed. But has my love for her changed?</em> The answer was simple – no. It had never wavered.</p>
                <p>And now, here we are, together. So different from before, yet everything still feels the same.</p>
                <div>I am who I am. She is who she is. But our love, it’s always been the same.</div>
                <div><em>Always her<em>.<br>

                <em>Always us.<em></div>
