                <p>Dear Diary,</p>
                <p>It all started in ninth grade. I was just a girl, unsure of who I really was. I couldn’t even begin to understand why I felt so different. But then… she hugged me. It wasn’t like anything else I had experienced. I hadn’t been hugged much in my life. My family never really showed affection, and I didn’t know what to do with it at first. But when she wrapped her arms around me, it felt like I finally mattered. For the first time, my heart didn’t feel so heavy. It was like a spark ignited, like something had come alive inside me.</p>
                <p>I remember thinking, <em>What is this? What am I feeling?</em> But I told myself it was just a crush. It was fleeting, I convinced myself. A moment that would pass. Yet, every time I saw her, I craved that warmth, the way her arms felt around me. <em>I want to feel that again,</em> I thought, but I buried it deep down. There was no way I could understand it, and there was no way I could let anyone know. I couldn't even accept it myself.</p>
                <p>I couldn’t bring myself to admit it. I rejected any thoughts of liking girls. I rejected anything that didn’t fit the “normal” way of being. And yet, every time she laughed, every time she smiled, I felt this ache deep in my chest, this longing. <em>Is it just me? Am I just imagining this?</em></p>
                <p>Then senior high school came, and we grew closer. We became classmates, sharing everything – notes, jokes, dreams. I loved that about us. I loved the way we understood each other without even speaking sometimes. But as she bloomed, grew more confident, I found myself falling deeper for her. And the worst part was, I couldn’t tell her. I couldn’t even say it to myself. <em>What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I be like everyone else?</em></p>
                <p>She was so beautiful, so sure of herself. I wanted to be like her. No, more than that – I wanted to be with her. But every time I even thought about telling her, something inside me froze. <em>What if she doesn’t feel the same? What if she sees me as nothing more than a friend?</em></p>
                <p>I wanted to say, <em>I’m feeling something I don’t understand,</em> but I couldn’t. I couldn’t risk it.</p>
